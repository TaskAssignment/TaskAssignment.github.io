## Welcome to TaskAssignment

This is the needed documentation to continue the development of this software.
It's intended to help developers with previous information and assumptions made throughout the development course.

One important architectural decision is the profile division for Developers and Bugs.
They are similar and yet different.
These abstractions are needed to analyze data from different sources, like GitHub, Bugzilla, StackOverflow.
More details on each one bellow.

Check more on [bugs](/bugs), [developers](/developers) or on the [API docs](/api).


## For the specific documentation of

- General extractor [Bugzilla](/generalextractor)
- Deployment Tools  [Deployment](/deploymentTools)
