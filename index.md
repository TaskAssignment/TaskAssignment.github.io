## Manage Data

The first thing to do when using the system is to populate the database. If you are not the first user, it's possible it is already populated. You can check that by exporting the data.

## Visualize similarity

After you have the database populated, you can check the similarity between bugs and developers.
To do that, you can look for the name of the project you want to analyze. The search bar will appear once you hover the mouse over the magnifying glass icon.

When you press the magnifying glass, the projects with the searched name will appear, separated by their source, GitHub and Bugzilla, as of right now. Select the desired project and the bugs will appear on the left side of your screen.
