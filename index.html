        <p>
            This is the needed documentation to continue the development of this software.
            It's intended to help developers with previous information and assumptions made throughout the development course.
        </p>

        <p>
            One important architectural decision is the profile division for Developers and Bugs.
            They are similar and yet different.
            These abstractions are needed to analyze data from different sources, like GitHub, Bugzilla, StackOverflow.
            More details on each one bellow.
        </p>

        <h3>Bugs</h3>

        <p> Bugs can come from GitHub or Bugzilla, as of now.
            Those are considered subprofiles and reference a <code> Bug </code>
            that will contain the basic information for a bug analized in this system.
            Check the <a href="/api/Bug.html">Bug documentation</a> to know what is this basic information.
        </p>

        <p> For now, a <code> Bug </code> must be created just before the creation of a
            specific profile. The specific profile must, then, reference the general <code> Bug </code>.
            Because this is not an issue tracker, and we fetch bugs from other places, <code> Bug </code> _id must be the
            a 2 letter acronym representing the origin plus the specific id. Example:
            A Bug from GitHub has an <code> id </code> equals to 123. If I fetch this bug to the system database,
            I'll have a <code> GitHubIssue </code> with _id 123 that will reference a <code> Bug </code> with _id 'GH123'.
            A Bug from Bugzilla with the same id, would reference a <code> Bug </code> with
            _id 'BZ123'.
        </p>

        <p> This ensures that bugs from different sources with the same id will have different ids on our database.
            It's also an easy way to check the source of a bug. And, because an id is already unique inside a system,
            like a GitHub id, we can safely refer to them when any other information on the bug is needed.
        </p>

        <h3> Developers </h3>

        <p> Right now we have developer profiles from StackOverflow, GitHub and Bugzilla.
            Users are 'merged' under a common <code> Developer </code> profile using their emails.
        </p>
        <p> To add new profiles, a schema must be created, and <code> Developer </code>
            must reference it.
            Check the <a href="/api/Developer.html">Developer documentation</a> for more information.
        </p>
